# Heart-Disease-Prediction-

Heart disease is the deadliest disease and one of leading causes of death worldwide. Machine learning is playing an essential role in the medical side. 
Objective is to perform the analysis of predictive analytics model to diagnose the various stages of heart patients by ensemble learning methods like Bagging,   Boosting and Voting which aims to enhance the accuracy of the deficient algorithms. 

The data is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. A csv file is available and can also be downloaded from the source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease . While there are multiple datasets available, here I have used the one processed by the Cleveland Clinic Foundation.
